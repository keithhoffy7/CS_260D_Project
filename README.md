# Project Overview

This repository contains our project Jupyter Notebook where all our project code is at `/CS_260D_Project.ipynb`. Our project required training many different ML models which takes a long time, so we have also included our pre trained models in `/CS260D_Final_Project`.

To run the notebook with our saved models, upload the `/CS260D_Final_Project` folder to google drive and place them in "My Drive". When running our notebook, skip all the model training cells and instead run the following cell that loads in the saved model.

We have also included a PDF version of our notebook with all of the cell outputs at `/CS_260D_Project.pdf`. The results in our report align with these outputs.
