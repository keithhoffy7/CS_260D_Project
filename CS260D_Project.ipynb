        "[NEW] Bilevel optimization defenses: Because many poisoning attacks can be framed as bilevel optimization problems, researchers are developing methods to solve the optimization problem in reverse to identify and neutralize poisoned data points. Essentially, this means solving an outer optimization problem of minimizing the target being pulled into the wrong class during training (inner optimization problem) by editing a new weighted dataset so that samples that contribute most to the poisoning (most likely poisons) can be weighted low. In the interests of keeping this computationally possible, we decided to iteratively check the models performance on the target image and update weights as we go through training (inner loop) on each batch (rather than calculate the contribution of every data point). We are dynamically reweighting training samples!"

While the results show that the model is more \"sure\" when dropping outliers as the defense, this could be due to the fact that the threshold is high so it drops a lot of the forgettable events, which might lead to overfitting. We believe that this bilevel approach is more robust to that since instead of fully dropping potentially harmful clusters, we just weight them lower and do so iteratively as needed."
